[@CardanoTrees](https://twitter.com/CardanoTrees) has built the first on-chain trees living and growing in Cardano Blockchain. Yes, that's right. All code and art are written on the blockchain entirely and the art itself dynamically changes over time. 

Because Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain, it's a beautiful place to grow nature in it! Using generative art techniques, the whole tree that evolve and live forever are generated with only 4kb code.

Due to the small size code, it is possible to mint it fully onchain! No IPFS required!

## Let's take a look at the Demo Tree

Let's take a look at a demo tree that has super accelerated growth. 

[View Demo Here](https://pool.pm/386707e1dd9ae353a49480c576a680266e48737be00c1515ec3e715d.CTDemo04)

The main purpose of this demo is to show tree evolutions in an accelerated growth mode. Growth modes in trees of the original collection move at a much slower pace. Not only that, each tree has a set of geographic coordinates that behave based on the time of day the coordinates are located around the world.

Simply beautiful right! It's a struggle to put into words all aspects of this masterpiece. Showing only static images of the project wouldn't do justice to the full experience of the art. 

## Do you have a roadmap and whitepaper of future goals for the project? 
In fact we do and it's quite extensive! There's a lot we're excited about. Feel free to take a look at our PDF document here.
