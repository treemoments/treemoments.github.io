[@CardanoTrees](https://twitter.com/CardanoTrees) are the first on-chain trees living and growing in Cardano Blockchain. Yes, you read that right. All code and art are written on the blockchain entirely and the art itself dynamically changes over time. 

Because Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain, it's a beautiful place to grow art-ificial nature! Using generative art techniques, the whole tree portrait that evolves over time and lives forever is generated with only 4kb code.

Due to the small size code, it is possible to mint it fully onchain! No IPFS required!

## Let's take a look at the Demo Tree

![](/images/tree_species/demo_1.png) 

Before we start diving into the original CardanoTrees collection of 10,000 trees that sold out in less than 2 days in August of 2021, let's take a look at a demo tree that has super accelerated growth. 

[View Demo Here](https://pool.pm/386707e1dd9ae353a49480c576a680266e48737be00c1515ec3e715d.CTDemo04)

The main purpose of this demo is to show tree evolutions in an accelerated growth mode. Growth in trees of the original collection move at a much slower pace. Not only that, each tree has a set of geographic coordinates that behave based on 50 years of historical data for where they are located around the world.

Simply beautiful right! It's a struggle to put into words all aspects of this masterpiece. Showing only static images of the project wouldn't do justice to the full experience of the art, so we've provided gifs but even these don't fully capture the smoothness and tranquility of the actual trees!

## Tree Species Designs
There are five different tree species in the original CardanoTrees collection including:

- Alpha
- Beta
- Gamma
- Delta
- Epsilon

Each of these species are beautiful and unique for different reason.

## Alpha Species

![](/images/tree_species/CT0347.png) 

Total Trees: 300 

Rarity Types: Rare Only 

Special Features: Flowers, Fruits in the spring. The trunk turns white in the snow. It's the only species that provides fruits.

Here's an example of what one of the Alpha's like at night.

## Beta Species

Total Trees: 770 (150 SuperRare, 620 Uncommon) 

Rarity Types: SuperRare, Uncommon 

Special Features: Trunk turns white in the snow, SuperRares can grow double trunks

Here's an example of what one of the Beta's like at night.

## Gamma Species

Total Trees: 1100 (300 Rare, 800 Uncommon) 

Rarity Types: Rare, Uncommon 

Special Features: Flowers, Trunk turns white in snow

Here's an example of what one of the Gamma's like at night without the animation.

## Delta Species

Total Trees: 3430 (30 EpicRare, 900 Uncommon, 2500 Common) 

Rarity Types: EpicRare, Uncommon, Common 

Special Features: Entire tree turns white in the snow, does not become sticks

Here's an example of what one of the Alpha's like at night.

## Epsilon Species

Total Trees: 4400 (150 SuperRare, 1150 Uncommon, 3100 Common) 

Rarity Types: SuperRare, Uncommon, Common 

Special Features: Trunk turns white in snow

Here's an example of what one of the Alpha's like at night.

## Seasons and Weather Conditions
Not only do these NFTs change based on time of day, but also time of year with seasonality. Rain and thunder clouds, snow, snowflakes, sunshine, and more. The entire tree community loves checking in on their trees and watching how they change over time! And it's all stored in 4KB of code.

## Each point in time is never the same
The art is constantly changing and will never be the same at any given point in time. Sometimes you might see flowers, fruits, or even see the tree shrink based on seasons. They all live on the blockchain, forever through these changes. 

## Stick Form
Every species except for Deltas completely lose their leaves in the winter and enter stick form. Deltas lose some of their leaves but similar to the evergreen trees they resemble, they maintain most of their leaves throughout the winter.

Below is a look at some examples of what each species looks like in stick form.

## Do you have a roadmap and whitepaper of future goals for the project? 
In fact we do and it's quite extensive! There's a lot we're excited about. Feel free to take a look at our PDF document here.

[Roadmap](https://cardanotrees.com/CTWhitepaper.pdf)

Hop on over to our Discord server if you have any specific questions.

## Can I still buy one of the original CardanoTrees? 
Although the original CardanoTrees collection was originally sold out in less than 2 days you can still buy one in the secondary market. 

We highly recommend for you to hop on over to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/d984qqvs) to chat with our amazing community and ask any questions you might have to ensure you're buying a legitimate CardanoTrees asset. It's important to pay attention to things like policy ID so you're not buying a fake copy. 

## The Cardano Global Impact Challenge: Planting 1 million trees
Damian, the creator of CardanoTrees, is one of the original supporting artists for the Cardano Global Impact Challenge with a goal to plant 1 million trees. This projects' roots extend far wider than most know and Damian is working with the Cardano Foundation to deliver more value to the entire Cardano NFT ecosystem while also promoting CardanoTrees mission to become the premier NFT for building a more sustainable future.

## Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain
Because Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain, it's a beautiful place to growth nature in it!!!
